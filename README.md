## Functionality

The Champion MT4 Expert Advisor is a trading algorithm designed to provide stable monthly profits and constant growth in the forex market. It utilizes a unique trading algorithm to make trading decisions based on the current and previous candle data.

The Expert Advisor is initialized by setting the previous candle values to zero. On each tick, the Expert Advisor checks if the current candle has closed by comparing the current candle close price with the previous candle close price. If the candle has closed, the Expert Advisor calculates the dynamic deviation, performs trading decisions based on the unique trading algorithm, and updates the previous candle values.

The Expert Advisor also includes functions for risk management and optimization. The RiskManagement function implements risk control and reduction logic to minimize losses and maximize gains. The OptimizeSettings function is used to optimize the settings for stable monthly profit and constant growth.
